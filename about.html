<p>
I like starting things and building solutions to problems with what I do best – code. I'd like to think I'm past my Dunning-Kruger phase, but do take what I say with a grain of salt.
</p>

<p>
I am currently a Software Engineer at <a href="http://tictail.com">Tictail</a> in Stockholm. We're working towards a grand vision – be the world's most used and loved e-commerce platform.
</p>

<p>
Prior to Tictail, I was in London for 6 years where I completed my degree in Computing at <a href="http://imperial.ac.uk">Imperial College London</a>, got captivated by the startup world, freelanced, worked as an engineer at <a href="http://editd.com">EDITD</a>, interned at <a href="http://bloomberg.com">Bloomberg</a> and had tons of fun.
</p>

<p>
I'm experienced in <a href="http://github.com/alexmic/microtemplates">Python</a> and <a href="http://github.com/alexmic/filtrr">JavaScript</a>. I can also design slightly better than the average software engineer. I've dabbled around with web and service-oriented architectures, "quite big" data, computer vision and interaction design.
</p>

<p>
In a parallel universe, I'd be willing to spare 8 years to become a doctor.
